“Transaction Tracker” is a responsive web application which is created exclusively for the use of suppliers and dealers to keep track of the transactions between them and be notified about payments to be completed and those overdue. 

A supplier is a person, company, or organization that sells or supplies something such as goods or equipment to customers whereas a dealer is an individual or firm that buys goods from a producer or distributor for wholesale and/or retail reselling. When dealers buy products for their shops from suppliers, they tend to not pay the whole valued amount to the suppliers until the goods are sold.
The pending payments between suppliers and dealers most often are kept track of by using record books and generally when a payment is not completed and overdue, the supplier company has to call the dealer company to let them know that the payment has not been done. This sometimes leads to complications in the relationship between the respective supplier company and dealer company. Also, since the dealers are busy with the transactions occurring between them and the customers too, the payments related to transactions between them and the suppliers are often forgotten to be completed on time. Always being attentive about the payments too is not easy when there are many transactions happening with many companies.

‘Transaction Tracker’ is a solution to these issues as it allows suppliers and dealers to have different accounts on the website, to store the transaction details and be notified through the website and email notifications about the payments to be completed and those overdue. It also allows the suppliers and dealers to post about their companies, share latest news and thus help to promote brand awareness and increase visibility.

There is no contact between a supplier company and another supplier company, or between a dealer company and another dealer company within the system. This application allows suppliers to insert new transactional records to the system, update them,view the transactions and the updation history of each transaction whereas the dealers are allowed only to view the transactions and the updation history of each transaction they are related to. Both suppliers and dealers are allowed to post posts.
